Physics-Based VR Engine

Overview:

The Physics-Based VR Engine is a robust, modular interaction system designed to bring advanced physics interactions to virtual reality experiences. Inspired by VR titles such as Boneworks and Bonelab, this project aims to create a comprehensive physics rig that enables realistic object manipulation, movement, and environmental interaction.

This engine's core systems are:
Grabbing and manipulating objects
Body physics simulation
Environmental interactions
Multiplayer support

Features:

Advanced Physics Rig

-Full-body physics simulation for VR characters
-Dynamic object interaction based on real-world physics

Grabbing and Manipulation

-Physics-based grabbing system that adapts to object shapes and sizes
-Two-handed interactions for large objects
-Support for realistic force application (e.g., pushing, pulling, throwing)

Environmental Interactions

-Automated water physics
-Physics object adhesion
-Dynamic environments that respond to player actions

Multiplayer Support

-Networked interactions using Unity's Netcode for GameObjects (NGO)
-Synced physics objects across clients
-Support for both single-player and multiplayer modes

Future Plans:

-Integrate AI-driven NPCs with physics-based behaviors
-More object interactivity templates
